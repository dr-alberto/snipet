# Configuring Apache on Windows

1. **Apache Configuration File**: The main configuration file is located at `C:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf`. You can edit this file to configure Apache:

   ```bash
   notepad C:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf
   ```

2. **Test Configuration**: After making changes, you can test the configuration for syntax errors by running:

   ```bash
   httpd -t
   ```

3. **Reload Apache**: If there are no errors, you can restart Apache to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   httpd -k restart
   ```
