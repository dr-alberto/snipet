# Creating a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed, the next step is to create a pull request (PR). This allows others to review and merge your changes.

1. **Go to the repository page** on your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

2. You should see an option to **Compare & Pull Request** next to the branch you just pushed. Click this button.

3. **Fill in the PR details**:
   - Provide a **title** summarizing the changes.
   - Include a **description** detailing what was changed and why.

4. Select the **base branch** (usually `main` or `master`) and ensure your branch is set as the **compare branch**.

5. **Create the pull request** by clicking the "Create Pull Request" button.
