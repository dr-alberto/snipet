# Cloning a Repository in Git

To clone a repository, follow these steps:

1. **Get the Repository URL**

   Obtain the URL of the repository you want to clone. This can be found on the repository page, often under a button labeled "Clone" or "Code."

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository. For example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
   ```

3. **Change into the Repository Directory**

   After cloning, navigate into the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```
